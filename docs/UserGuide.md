## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Commands that do not take in parameters (`help`, `list`, `copyemails`, `undo`, `redo`, `previous`, `next`, `clear`, `exit`) will not be recognized if there are extraneous parameters.
  This is to protect from accidental invocations of the wrong command. <br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `clear 1`, it will be interpreted as an invalid command. The proper format is `clear`.

### Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [c/CONTACTED DATE] [m/MEMO] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person’s tags or memo by typing `t/` or `m/` respectively without specifying text after it.
* You can edit a peron's contacted date to "Not contacted" by typing `c/` without specifying a date after it.

Examples:
* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

### Locate persons by name, phone number, tags, email, address, memo and last contacted date:`find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [m/MEMO] [t/TAG] [c/Days]…​`
* The search is case-insensitive. E.g. hans will match Hans
* At least 1 parameter must be present.
* More than 2 whitespace between words are treated as 1 whitespace. So "Alex_ _ _Yeoh" would be treated as "Alex_Yeoh" where "_" represents a single whitespace.
* Name, phone number, email, address, memo, tags and contacted status are eligible parameters.
* Specifying the parameter followed by the word to search for helps to scope the search to that specific attribute.
* Name, phone number and email follows a partial word match criteria where "Han" will match with "Hans" and "904" would match with "90400203".
* For contacted status, the matching depends on the "days" argument given by the user and suppose the number of days specified is n, the find method searches for contacts that were contacted at least n day days ago. 
* For contacted status, if no integer value is given as an argument, the find command would just return contacts that had not been contacted.
* Tag, address and memo follows an exact word match criteria where "Hans" will match with "Hans" or "hans".
* For both search criteria, order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. Hans Bo will match Bo Hans
* For both search criteria, as long as there is a word match (partial/exact), the contact would be in the filtered list. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: A word is defined as consecutive characters that is bounded by whitespaces.
e.g. "This is a sentence!" contains the word "This", "is", "a" and "sentence!".** <br>

Examples:
* `find n/ John` returns john and John Doe
* `find n/alex n/david` returns Alex Yeoh and David Li and Alexa.
* If David Li has an email davidLi98@gmail.com, then `find e/gmail` would return David Li. 
* If John has a phone number 90400202, then `find p/9040` would return John.
* If John has a phone number 90400202, then `find p/202` would return John.
* `find n/alex yeo` would only match with contacts that have "alex yeo" contained within their name. For example, "Alex Yeoh" would be a successful match.
* If John has a tag family, then `find t/family` would return John.
* If John has a tag family, then `find t/fam` would return no result.
* `find c/1` would find contacts that were contacted 1 or more days ago.
* `find c/` would find contacts that had not been contacted.
