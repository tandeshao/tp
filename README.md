## What is AddressBook π (Abπ)?

**Abπ** is an improvement of **[AB3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)** and it is optimized specifically for
users who prefer typing via the Command Line Interface(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
It helps users keep track of their professional contacts, separating it from their personal contacts.
